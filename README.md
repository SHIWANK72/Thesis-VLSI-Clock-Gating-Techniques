# Thesis: Investigation of Novel Clock Gating Techniques

This repository contains the documentation and sample code for my undergraduate thesis on clock gating techniques. The clock network is one of the largest sources of power consumption in synchronous digital systems. This research explores methods to reduce this dynamic power by deactivating the clock to idle modules.

## Project Overview
[cite_start]The core objective was to analyze and implement clock gating to prevent unnecessary switching activity in idle functional blocks, thereby saving a significant amount of dynamic power. 

## Concepts Investigated
- **Dynamic Power Consumption**: A deep dive into the `P = C * V^2 * f * a` equation, with a focus on reducing the activity factor (`a`).
- **Latch-Free vs. Latch-Based Clock Gating**: Analysis of different implementation styles. Latch-based gating is generally preferred as it is glitch-free and safer for synthesis.

## Implementation & Analysis
A standard, latch-based clock gating cell was implemented in Verilog to demonstrate the concept. The logic uses an enable signal to control the clock flow to a downstream register bank.

The efficacy of this technique was validated by integrating the clock gating cell into a benchmark digital circuit. [cite_start]The design was then analyzed using **Synopsys tools** to: [cite: 47]
1.  Synthesize the design correctly, ensuring timing constraints were met.
2.  Run power analysis simulations both with and without clock gating.
3.  Quantify the percentage reduction in dynamic power.

## Key Learnings
This research provided a strong understanding of low-power design methodologies used in the industry. It offered practical experience in writing synthesizable Verilog for power-sensitive applications and using professional EDA tools for power analysis and verification.
